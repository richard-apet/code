/BANNERS/
Integrated within Google Web Designer templates, published as local files.

/VIDEO PLAYER/
Custom controls as specified on the brief, referencing 'FontAwesome' icons.

/WORLD CLOCK/
Simple analogue clock functionality was referenced from 'dyclassroom', with timezone offsets handling researched from the 'jClocksGMT' jQuery plugin. I opted to keep this vanilla js, to ensure the timezone functionality was applied using my own code rather than via a plugin, with the timezone offset variables are applied when the parent container id is updated by the Event Listeners on each button.

The brief only covered basic functionality requirements, non-specific with regards to timezones, so the design is based on these requirements accordingly. As such this would be considered a first step to elicit from end users, and would be developed further by determining which browsers/devices to target, size requirements and handling a potentially greater number of specific timezones.
